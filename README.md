# Dreambooth - Son Goku
Here is a sample notebook I've made with [Shivam Shrirao's Dreambooth scripts](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/raw/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py).  
My goal was to get a Stable Diffusion model that is able to generate some high quality images of Son Goku.  
I ran the notebook and trained the model on Google Colab with only a T4 (free tier).
